tic tac toe tutorial from the coding train using p5.js
well this in not my project. I followed a tutorial from the youtube channel called "the coding train" to discover the p5.js library of javascript.
It seemed interseting and i wanted to try it. I discovered and understood new stuff during this tut, and my mind is thinking more like a programmer.
